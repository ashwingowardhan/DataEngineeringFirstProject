    - Jupyter Notebook
    
### Description of files and folders
  
  ##### 1. "Data Model Exercise.ipynb" file
      This file contains step-by-step instructions on how to create a Data model for a dataset using Python.
  ##### 2. "Data for data modeling" folder
      This folder contains three ".csv" files that contain data that is used to create a data model.
  ##### 3. "Data Engineering Project 1.ipynb" file
      This file is used to create a data model using Python and this file uses data from three ".csv" files.
      
 ##### 4. "Schema Diagram and Schema Implementation on dvdrental dataset"
        This folder contains three folders
 ######      1.dvdrental dataset
            This folder contains "dvdrental" dataset which includes information about film sales and payments.

 ######      3. Schema Implementation
             This folder contains two files written in "SQL" and performs a schema implementation by using schema diagrams
               -"build_star_schema_for_dvdrental_dataset.sql" This file implements star schema.
               -"dataAnalytics_on_dvdrental_dataset.sql" this file implements a relational model
